# Cast Iron
## An ECDSA secure API signing library to accomodate secure communication with an Iron server.
Thank you to [iron-hmac](https://github.com/jwilm/iron-hmac/) for the amazing work and contribution. Albeit a good few years out of date now. HMAC 256 is a great algorithm, but new standards advise the use of ECDSA for secure hashing.
