<h1>Cast Iron</h1>
<h2>An ECDSA secure API signing library to accomodate secure communication with an Iron server.</h2>
<p>Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/iron-hmac/">iron-hmac</a> for the amazing work and contribution. Albeit a good few years out of date now. HMAC 256 is a great algorithm, but new standards advise the use of ECDSA for secure hashing.</p>
